# node-netsend, a dropbox.js Sample Application

This application demonstrates the use of the JavaScript client library for the
Dropbox API to implement a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) Web application that
mimics the "net send" command.

To see this sample in action, install node.js and issue the following commands
in the sample's directory.

```bash
npm install           # Get the dependencies.
npm run-script reset  # Build/rebuild the database.
npm start             # Run the server.
```
